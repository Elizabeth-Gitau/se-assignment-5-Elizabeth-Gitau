9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

   Setting Up and Starting Debugging in VS Code

 1. Prerequisites:

 Supported Language: Ensure your program is written in a language supported by VS Code. Most popular languages have built-in debugging support or extensions available.
 Launch Configuration: Create a launch configuration file (launch.json) to define how VS Code should launch and debug your program. VS Code can often help you create this file automatically.

 2. Create a Launch Configuration (if needed):

 Open the Run and Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D or Cmd+Shift+D on macOS).
 Click the Create a launch.json file link.
 Choose your programming language from the options. VS Code will generate a basic launch configuration template.

 3. Set Breakpoints:

 Open your program file in the editor.
 Click on the line number where you want to pause execution during debugging. A red dot will appear indicating a breakpoint.

 4. Start Debugging:

 Click the green Run and Debug button (play icon) in the Run and Debug view.
 Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut F5.

 5. Debugging Features:

 Once your program hits a breakpoint, VS Code enters debug mode. Here are some key features you can utilize:

 -Step Over: Executes the current line of code and moves to the next line (without stepping into functions).
 -Step Into: Executes the current line of code and steps into any function calls that occur on that line.
 -Step Out: Executes the current line of code and exits the current function.
 -Continue: Resumes program execution until the next breakpoint or program termination.
 -Call Stack: View the call stack to see the sequence of function calls that led to the current program state.
 -Variables: Inspect the values of variables at any point during execution.
 -Console: Interact with your program's console output within VS Code.


10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
 Step by Step:

 1. Install Git
  Before you begin, ensure that Git is installed on your machine. You can download Git from git-scm.com and follow the installation instructions.

 2. Open Your Project in VS Code
Open VS Code and navigate to the root folder of your project.

 Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
 Type Git: Initialize Repository and press Enter.
 Select the folder you want to initialize as a Git repository.
 4. Stage and Commit Changes
 Now that your repository is initialized, you can start tracking changes and making commits:

 Stage Changes:

 -In the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+G on macOS), you'll see a list of changed files.
 -Click the + button next to a file to stage it for the next commit. Alternatively, you can stage all changes by clicking the + button at the top of the Source Control view.

 Commit Changes:

 After staging your changes, enter a commit message in the text box at the top of the Source Control view.
 Press Ctrl+Enter (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Enter (macOS) to commit the changes.
 5. Push Changes to GitHub
 To push your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub:

 Add Remote Repository URL:

 If you haven't added your GitHub repository as a remote, you can do so using the integrated terminal in VS Code or through the Command Palette:
 Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
 Type Git: Add Remote and press Enter.
 Enter a name for your remote (e.g., origin) and the URL of your GitHub repository.

 Push Changes:

  Once your remote is set up, you can push your changes to GitHub:
  Open the Command Palette.
  Type Git: Push and press Enter.
  VS Code will prompt you to select the branch you want to push (usually main or master).
  Enter your GitHub credentials if prompted.
